# The Rick And Morty App

Hi 😁 this is my project and I decided to built a List of Products and and the Product Search features. The tecnologies that I use for the test are:

- React
- Sass
- Webpack
- Babel
- Prettier
- ESLint

For consuming the data I use the [Rick and Morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) API provided that I really love the show 😅

And for the deployment I use Vercel.

You can check the final product in this url: [MJV-test](http://mjv.vercel.app/ 'MJV-test')
Or, you can copy the Repo and run the proyect with:

`yarn start`

or

`npm run start`

I also add a script for formating the code with prettier:

`yarn format`

or

`npm run format`

and, there are a final sacript that show you if you have errors in your code, so you can fix them before deploy it to production:

`yarn lint`

or

`npm run lint`

Thanks!
